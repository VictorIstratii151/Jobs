# Jobs
laravel project which lists different available jobs

List of tasks, which I have tried to implement ('+' - done; '-' - nope)

1) A view to lisk all the jobs. Page has to contain a search with categories  +
2) A view to show a job in a detailed manner                                  +
3) A Laravel project which uses Eloquent to communicate with database         +
4) Database Schema and Tables to be populated using migrations                +
5) Application with RESTful endpoints                                         +
6) The views have to use jQuery in order to process the RESTful data          +
7) The application has to be able to be installed by Composer and Bower       -


Also, the search does not work properly, I was not able to provide a good api for searching by categories.
